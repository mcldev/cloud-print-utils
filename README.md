# Cloud Print Utils

This is a collection of AWS Lambda layers and functions to render pdf documents
and images from HTML.

Currently solutions based on these tools available:

- [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/)
- [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/)

To build a layer you need **make** and **docker** installed on your system.
The layers support only amazon linux 2 runtimes, eg. python3.8, nodejs12.x.

By default only minimal subset of system fonts [installed](fonts/layer_builder.sh) if you need more fonts
set `EXTRA_FONTS` env variable with space separated list
of font packages to install, eg:

    EXTRA_FONTS="liberation-fonts xorg-x11-fonts-cyrillic" make build/weasyprint-layer-python3.8.zip

You can search for available font packages with `make fonts.list`.
